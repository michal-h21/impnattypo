A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel.

The charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. 

I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be
incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
